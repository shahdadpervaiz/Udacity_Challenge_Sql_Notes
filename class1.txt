## 1 Basic SQL Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we will cover and you will be able to:

Describe why SQL is important
Explain how SQL data is stored and structured
Create SQL queries using proper syntax including
SELECT & FROM
LIMIT
ORDER BY
WHERE
Basic arithmetic operations
LIKE
IN
NOT
AND & BETWEEN & OR
There is a lot to cover so let's get started!

This course will cover different uses of SQL but will focus on data analysis.

SQL is used in virtually every industry so get read to superpower your skillset.

## 2 Parch & Posey Database

In this course, we will mostly be using the Parch & Posey database for our queries. Whenever we use a different database, we will let you know.

Parch & Posey (not a real company) is a paper company and the database includes sales data for their paper.

Using the sales data, you'll be able to put your SQL skills to work with data you would find in the real world.

##3 Entity Relationship Diagrams

An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a common way to view data in a database. Below is the ERD for the database we will use from Parch & Posey.
These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:

The names of the tables.
The columns in each table.
The way the tables work together.
You can think of each of the boxes below as a spreadsheet.

What to Notice
In the Parch & Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):

web_events
accounts
orders
sales_reps
region

You can think of each of these tables as an individual spreadsheet. Then the columns in each spreadsheet are listed below the table name.
For example, the region table has two columns: id and name. Alternatively, the web_events table has four columns.

The "crow's foot" that connects the tables together shows us how the columns in one table relate to the columns in another table.
In this first lesson, you will be learning the basics of how to work with SQL to interact with a single table. 
In the next lesson, you will learn more about why these connections are so important for working with SQL and relational databases.
